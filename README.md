# Online Retail Project

Welcome to my project that utilizes Databricks and PySpark to analyze and create regression models from a transnational dataset. This dataset contains all the transactions that took place between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. By using PySpark, we can efficiently process and manipulate large volumes of data in a distributed computing environment. Our goal is to evaluate this dataset and create regression models that will help us understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on sales. With Databricks, we have access to a powerful collaborative data platform that will allow us to share and collaborate on our findings with ease. Through this project, we hope to gain valuable insights that will help improve the performance and profitability of the retail business.

#### -- Data Mining Methodology 

In this project, I have utilized the CRISP (Cross Industry Standard Process) methodology, a widely used framework for data mining and machine learning projects, to guide my analysis and decision-making process.
